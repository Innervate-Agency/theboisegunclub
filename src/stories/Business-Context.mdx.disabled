# BUSINESS PIVOT CONTEXT
**From BGC Board Drama to Treasure Valley Firearms Empire**

## üéØ THE TRANSFORMATION

**OLD PROJECT:** Building a free website for an ungrateful gun club board
**NEW PROJECT:** "The Boise Gun Club: A Treasure Valley Firearm & Firearm Sport Collective"

    This pivot transforms 8+ years of volunteer work into a flagship business opportunity that showcases Innervate Agency's capabilities while serving the entire Treasure Valley firearms community.

## üìú BACKGROUND: THE BGC SAGA

### **8 Years of Unacknowledged Service (2017-2025)**
- Steve Duskett provided free web development, hosting, and maintenance
- Personally paid for hosting and domain management  
- Built multiple website iterations with zero compensation
- Saved the `boisegunclub.com` domain from public auction in 2021

### **The Breaking Point (April 2025)**
**Lahoma Turner's Text Message:**
> "So we are going to go a different route so can you cancel that? We are trying to get something easier so more of us can get involved. The club is trying to consolidate things and funnel our money into club improvements and not so much web stuff."

**Translation:** After 8 years of free services, they casually dismissed their volunteer webmaster via text message to use a basic .info site instead.

### **The Failed Negotiation (May-July 2025)**
- Steve offered to build a comprehensive enterprise website for free
- Board became hostile, calling professional expertise "arrogant"
- President asked "What's our ROI?" on a zero-investment project
- Demanded domain ownership after years of taking services for granted

### **The Legal Threats (July 2025)**
**Kent Graham's Threat:**
> "Give us a price to get .com back from your perceived ownership (right or wrong) or I personally will see you in court for much longer that you can possibly afford."

**Lahoma Turner's Business Threat:**
> "If that is truly your passion and you need a reference, how would you like us to represent Innervate Agency to your future clients?"

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL POSITION: BULLETPROOF OWNERSHIP

### **Domain Ownership Facts**
- BGC as an entity **NEVER** owned `boisegunclub.com`
- Previous owner: Brian Johnson ("ShortPocket Webdesigns") - private individual
- Current owner: Steve Duskett/Innervate Agency (legally transferred)
- BGC has **ZERO** legal standing to claim ownership

### **Evidence Documentation**
- GoDaddy registration records showing Brian Johnson ownership
- Legal transfer documentation to Innervate Agency
- 8+ years of legitimate business use
- No trademark rights held by BGC

**Bottom Line:** They can't sue for property they never owned. Their threats actually expose them to extortion and tortious interference charges.
